<h1>Active Directory: Installation and Configuration</h1>

<p> 
This project is the second in a collection focused on implementing Azure and Active Directory. The goal here is to install and configure Active Directory within a virtualised network environment, providing me with hands-on learning and practical experience in managing domain services in Microsoft Azure. In this project, I will set up Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller, create an Active Directory forest, and configure user accounts with administrative privileges. I will also join a Windows 10 Pro Client Virtual Machine to the domain, configure DNS settings, and establish Remote Desktop access for non-administrative users. This will allow me to manage users, devices, and authentication within a structured Active Directory environment.

<h1>Project Summary</h1>

üéâCongratulations! You have successfully installed and configured Active Directory in Azure!üéâ  

In this project, we deployed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine, creating a new Active Directory forest and setting up user accounts with administrative privileges. We joined a Windows 10 Pro Client Virtual Machine to the domain, configured DNS settings, and verified connectivity. Additionally, we enabled Remote Desktop access for non-administrative users, ensuring proper authentication and domain management within the Active Directory environment.
